Listener

One user when he wants to connect to oracle database using SQL dev, oracle client 

We will userid 
password 
 
which will go to oracle listener
Oracle will send those details to oracle listerner , which in turn will send the details to pmon

listener will be created automatically when database is installed
Default name of the listerner ->Listener
Location:  $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora
default Port : 1521
Present in listener.ora

On client side we have tnsnames.ora 

Database and listener are independent services

How is listener registered?

_> Static registration -> When two databases are static with different port numbers, two listerners cannot run with two different port, so static registered is required, we need to add sid and port numbers in listerner.ora(like 1522)

-> Dynamic registration-> As soon as we have a database installed , the name , port are default (listener,ora) through LREG 

Listener should always be up and running
