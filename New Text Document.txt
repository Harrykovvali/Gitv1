User->Create table-> data stores data in datafiles 


Tablespace is collection of datafiles
when the user is trying to insert the data, it will go to datafiles under tablespace in which user is assigned


default tablespace 
Temperory tablespace


Users
System-> Used by sysuser, meta table information is stored in the system tablespace 
sysaux->AWR, AUdit table info is stored in sysaux tablespace

undo -> To roll back any statement , undo tablespace is used
temp-> sorting and joining operations are under temp tablespace
Users are assigned to default tablespace and temp tablespace. 
users are assigned to temp tablespace when join operations are happening


created automatically during the time of installation

when tablespace is not assigned it will go to user tablespace 

datafile size in a tablespace depends on the block size(IF bblocksize 8KB 32GB)

When the 32GB is full the error comes tablespace is full

So two options

add datafiles 
resize the datafile-

In both there should be enough space in the OS to add the datafile, but the maximum one datafile should be only 32GB


we can add multiple datafiles
